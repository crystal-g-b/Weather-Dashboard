  ## User Story

  As A traveler
  I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
  SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
  THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
  WHEN I view the UV index
  THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
  WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
  THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
